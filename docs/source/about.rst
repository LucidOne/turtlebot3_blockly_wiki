About
=====
`Dabit Industries <https://dabit.industries>`_ is the official reseller of the latest ROS based experimental platform - Turtlebot3. We want to help our customers to quickly understand and start programming the Turtlebot3. The usual way is to have a background on Linux, software engineering and some bit of Robotics but we want to introduce **Blockly** and make Turtlebot3 much more easier to program while having fun.

`Blockly <https://developers.google.com/blockly/>`_ is a free and open source web interface to program these turtlebots. Its intuitive drag-and-drop based programming style welcomes everyone to try out the logic based programming and is easy to get started. 

We will help you understand the required concepts to work with Blockly and get your turtlebots up and running in no time!

You can preorder the Turtlebot3 `here <https://dabit.industries/collections/turtlebot-3>`_.
There are two variants of this Turtlebot3 - `Waffle <https://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-3-waffle>`_ and `Burger <https://dabit.industries/products/turtlebot-3-burger>`_.
Make sure to check them out.
